# M320 KO1

## Terms to be Elaborated
Not part of this competence


## Project & Implementation
**Themenbereich**: Valorant (E-Sports Industry)

In this competence we were tasked with creating a Java 
Class & a bit ofe Code, with these requirements:
**Project Requirements**:
- They work only in a class (procedural) as in the module m319.
- You define a process, which you represent in an activity diagram. In the diagram you must use at least one loop, at least one decision and at least one abstraction. The diagram symbols must be correct.
- You create a simple TUI (text-based user interface). Input and output of data is mandatory.
- They map their process in code. You use at least two basic data types.

So we came up with the idea, to recreate the Valorant menu, in a TUI-based
output. Basically the User can decide, weather he wants to Play, Look at his Career, Battlepass progress,
Skin Collection, Agent Contracts or his Store, where he can buy skins that are in the item shop.
