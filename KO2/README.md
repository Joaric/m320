## Terms to be Elaborated

**Information hiding**: Information hiding is a software design principle







Information hiding is a software design principle, where certain aspects of a program or module (the “secrets”) 
are inaccessible to clients. The primary goal is to prevent extensive modification
to clients whenever the implementation details of a module or program are changed.

## Project & Implementation
**Themenbereich**: Valorant (E-Sports Industry)

In this competence we were tasked with creating a Java
Class & a bit ofe Code, with these requirements:
**Project Requirements**:
- They work only in a class (procedural) as in the module m319.
- You define a process, which you represent in an activity diagram. In the diagram you must use at least one loop, at least one decision and at least one abstraction. The diagram symbols must be correct.
- You create a simple TUI (text-based user interface). Input and output of data is mandatory.
- They map their process in code. You use at least two basic data types.

So we came up with the idea, to recreate the Valorant menu, in a TUI-based
output. Basically the User can decide, weather he wants to Play, Look at his Career, Battlepass progress,
Skin Collection, Agent Contracts or his Store, where he can buy skins that are in the item shop.
