## Terms to be Elaborated

**Inheritance**:
Inheritance in Java allows you to define a hierarchical order for classes and thus reduces the amount of redundant code. 
This means that you can inherit the attributes and methods of a class, so you don't have to code them again.

**Abstract classes**:  
Abstract classes are classes that serve as superclasses and cannot (themselves) be used to form objects. 
They are often used to define properties and capabilities of a general type group whose derived subclasses then specify
them further.


**Interface**:

An interface is an abstract "class" that is used to group related methods with "non-contental" bodies: To access the interface methods,
the interface must be "implemented" (similar to inheritant) by another class with the "implements" keyword (instead of extends).

**Polymorphism**:
Overriding and overloading are the core concepts in Java programming. They are the ways to implement polymorphism in our Java programs.
Polymorphism is one of the OOPS Concepts.


Overriding	                                                        Overloading
Implements “runtime polymorphism”	                                Implements “compile time polymorphism”
The method call is determined at runtime based on the object type	The method call is determined at compile time
Occurs between superclass and subclass                          	Occurs between the methods in the same class
Have the same signature (name and method arguments)	                Have the same name, but the parameters are different
On error, the effect will be visible at runtime                    	On error, it can be caught at compile time
